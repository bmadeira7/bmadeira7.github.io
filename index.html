      <img src="images/brian-marketplaceAsheville.jpeg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>I am a hard-working individual who enjoys to write code and work with audio. After graduating from Full Sail University, I began writing music and working with different record labels to commercially release my music on iTunes and Beatport. I recently graduated from the full stack web development bootcamp at UNC Charlotte. I like to collaborate with other developers and write Javascript to solve technical problems. I prefer to work on the front end of a project, although I possess the knowledge to work with the server and the database as well. My goal is to combine my knowledge of audio production with my coding skill set to implement new, exciting ideas and solutions within the entertainment industry.
